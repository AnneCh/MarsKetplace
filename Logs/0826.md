hahahaahahah, can't help but laugh at myself for getting stuck for several hours just for a missing pair of "".

so here we go, it turns out I had missed the fact that the object representing the address of the NFt deployed, `oneNftDeployed.address` in the error statement `` const error = `MarsKetplace__AlreadyListed("${oneNftDeployed.address}", ${TOKENID})` ``

I can't explain it yet, I thought the syntax for errors and events would be similar, but it looks like when testing events, "" are not necessary to surround addresses, while in errors, it is necessary for addresses to be enclosed in ""

- tested `yarn hardhat coverage`, and got a total of 66% covered (I was actually expecting less than that!)

=> wrote the test to check if the isListed modifier works, and the answer is no.

From the error that is thrown, I assume the problem comes from the listing :

```
 1) Unit MarsKetplace tests
       buyNFT function
         should revert if NFT is not listed:
     AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted with MarsKetplace__NotListed, but other exception was thrown: Error: cannot override "_hex","_isBigNumber","fromTwos","toTwos","abs","add","sub","div","mul","mod","pow","and","or","xor","mask","shl","shr","eq","lt","lte","gt","gte","isNegative","isZero","toNumber","toBigInt","toString","toHexString","toJSON" (operation="overrides", overrides=["_hex","_isBigNumber","fromTwos","toTwos","abs","add","sub","div","mul","mod","pow","and","or","xor","mask","shl","shr","eq","lt","lte","gt","gte","isNegative","isZero","toNumber","toBigInt","toString","toHexString","toJSON"], code=UNSUPPORTED_OPERATION, version=contracts/5.6.2)
```

Other error from trying the test to revert if price is not correct:

```
     AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted with MarsKetplace__PriceNotMet("0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3", 0, 10000000000000000), but other exception was thrown: Error: underflow [ See: https://links.ethers.org/v5-errors-NUMERIC_FAULT-underflow ] (fault="underflow", operation="BigNumber.from", value=0.01, code=NUMERIC_FAULT, version=bignumber/5.6.2)
```

=> Two things to fix tomorrow
