The image still is not displaying, but at this point it looks more like it's a problem coming from Pinata
My metadatas and images are correctly pinned but the image takes hours to load, if it even loads correctly.
I've already resized the picture, and it's like I've done nothing

The frontend is correctly grabbing the image, as a good ol' `console.log()` shows it :

```
{name: 'POM1', description: 'Here you are, you got your own POM1 !', image: 'ipfs://QmXRubWJeBDwyZ3vRYJFwza2HYBh1BavU6aThPzaUFGU19'}
```

but the image just never loads.

I want to take the time to work on a function that would catch the image not returning and instead of displaying the 'alt' text, would display a off-chain image (not cool for decentralization, I realise that, but I gotta find a work-around now and move along.)
