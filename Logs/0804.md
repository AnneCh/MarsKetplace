Following the tutorial, I've implemented the contract that will be minting the NFTs, wrote the deploy script for it;
I've written the script to upload my images to pinata and handle the token URIs

What needs to be done:
- re-write the contract to include a loop to mint all of our Tokens
- fix the issue of not getting the proper tokenID (add mapping )
- write unit tests to make sure all the NFTs are properly minted
