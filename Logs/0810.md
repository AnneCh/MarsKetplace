I've modified my smart contract to divide the mint function into two distinct functions.

From what I saw from other posts like this one (https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/erc721-mint-with-multiple-uris/20588/6), it's totally possible to mint a series of NFTs, so it should be working... the problem is that the event doe not seem to emit the arguments that I want it to.
