Browsing in Pinata, I realised that my NFTs had been minted twice, hence the second wave minted had no names, and the tokenURI that is returned is the first on of the list of no-named ones.

=> I'll delete them all, re pinned them with the script, change the unit test, test again, and then re-mint and verify if the IPFS address changes on the console.

=> Now the test is running smoothly, the URI is set correctly but in the console in the browser, the URI still returns undefined

I've checked the function on the NFTBox component, no matter what, it returns undefined.

I'll re-study the deploy script, maybe the problem comes from there
