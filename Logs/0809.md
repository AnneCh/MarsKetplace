After modifying the view function and the test script, I managed to run the tests successfully

Now, after trying to test if the event NFTMinted was being fired properly at the end of each function, the failure message tells me that the arguments are not being fired:

```
Basic NFT minting tests
    The owner can call the safeMint function
      1) Should emit the NFtMinted event after each token minted


  0 passing (2s)
  1 failing

  1) Basic NFT minting tests
       The owner can call the safeMint function
         Should emit the NFtMinted event after each token minted:
     AssertionError: Specified args not emitted in any of 10 emitted "NFTMinted" events
```

I have not figured out yet if the problem comes from the way I wrote my test's arguments or from the contract's code
