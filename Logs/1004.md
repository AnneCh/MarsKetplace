I took a few days off of this project to focus on ReactJS and going more in depth into certain concepts, which required a more followed focus than I expected.

I'm back on NFT Storage, and uploading one NFT and its metadata. I'll try using those CIDs and run the entire app on localhost once more, see if fetching the picture takes less time and actually happens.

Side note, DApp was on sleep mode on Moralis, I wonder if it;s going to do the same once deployed on Rinkeby ?

now let's try integrating it to the `MintOneToken`

=> commenting out deploying token minting contracts 2 and 3 for now to test my idea out

Everything is deploying, but the server is NOT receiving the data, not listening to the events.... I'm going to kill this server and deploy a new one, see if that fixes the problem ONCE MORE... if it does, then I'm not going get out of this experience with a positive experience from Moralis...
