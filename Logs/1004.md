I took a few days off of this project to focus on ReactJS and going more in depth into certain concepts, which required a more followed focus than I expected.

I'm back on NFT Storage, and uploading one NFT and its metadata. I'll try using those CIDs and run the entire app on localhost once more, see if fetching the picture takes less time and actually happens.

Side note, DApp was on sleep mode on Moralis, I wonder if it;s going to do the same once deployed on Rinkeby ?
