It's been a few times now that I have to or choose to give a problem a break , a day or more of not thinking about it, and the first time I get back to it, I solve it almost immediately. It's weird, but such a good feeling!

So, I fixed the testing price issue; it was coming from the fact that I was passing a decimal number into the `buyNFT()` instead of passing it the `wrongPrice` which is correctly formatted through `parseEther`

-> Now I'll go back to the test that reverts when the NFT is already listed!

-> about 20mn investigation lead me to figure out I had passed `price` into the `buyNFT()` without enclosing it into `{value : price}`
-> test passed

-> `✔ should update the contract's balance (80ms)`

-> `✔ should delete the purchased NFT from the s_NFTListed mapping (72ms)`

-> `✔ Should emit an NFTBought event (45ms)`

-> `✔ should revert if the msg.sender is not the owner (87ms)`

-> `✔ should revert if the NFT is not listed (53ms)`

-> `✔ Should emit an update ItemListed event (40ms)`
