Still stuck with the failing test, I still have not found the logical syntax to make it work.
I'll post the same post on github today, see if I can get more help.

At the same time, I kept following the NFt Marketplace tutorial to implement my own MarsKetplace contract.
I've written the functions and the boilerplate of tests, but now I'm stuck where I only have one single contract address to represent10 NFTs, when the tutorial takes a contract address per NFT.

It looks like I would have to make a contract per NFT and not be able to mint 10 NFTs in one contract, which will be fairly gas-expensive ... still have more research to do.

Meanwhile, I'll re-instate the test contract that was minting one single NFT and use it to test my MarsKetplace contract
