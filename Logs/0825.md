- To shorten my tests, I've commented out the test on about the NFT contract deployer approving the marsKetplace to sell the NFT, and integrated the function can to the `beforeEach()`

- I'm stuck with a typo error in my test, I'm not understanding why it is taking the address and turning it into a string.

```

 1) Unit MarsKetplace tests
       List item function
         Should revert if the NFT is already listed:
     AssertionError: Expected transaction to be reverted with MarsKetplace__AlreadyListed([object Object], 0), but other exception was thrown: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with custom error 'MarsKetplace__AlreadyListed("0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3", 0)'
```

=> look into stringify and reversal of stringification (?)
