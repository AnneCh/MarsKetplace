I tried everything again.

I synced everything, ran my script `mint-and-list` but no events were recorded.

I deleted the server, created a new one, replaced the data in my `.env` file and in the `frp` and `package.json` on the front-end by the new ones.
Now events are correctly received by Moralis... I think this is showing me that it's not a good long term solution for now, if I need to delete and create a new server every time there's a blockage on their side (second time now..), it means I can't display my projects correctly.

Now, there's still the pinata issue, not loading my stuff. Returning an undefined URI still to the front end...
I will try running the storage and pinning of my data through NFT Storage, making it the main goal of today and this week if it extends.
