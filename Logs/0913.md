I've been trying to integrate the script that would allow me to update the listed NFTs from lsited to deleted, on the Moralis server, but it does not work.

I created a `cancel` script, it does work properly because it fails when I use it twice in a row, throwing the custom error that the NFT is not present.
I still have to work that out, but I need to give it a day or two of rest.
