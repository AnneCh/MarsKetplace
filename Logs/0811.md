- removed the parameters from the constructor, as it's actually the role of the owner to call the `bulkMint()` and pass it in the array of token uris
- incremented the tokenId before the mint to start with the IDs at 1
- changed the deploy and test scripts accordingly

The test still fails with the same message, that the specified args were not emitted in any of 10 emitted NFTMinted events
=> that means the event fires properly each time the safeMint is called from bulkMint, problem is the arguments inside. But I still do not figure out if I'm writing the test wrongly or if the contract is the issue
