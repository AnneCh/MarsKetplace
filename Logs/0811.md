- removed the parameters from the constructor, as it's actually the role of the owner to call the `bulkMint()` and pass it in the array of token uris
- incremented the tokenId before the mint to start with the IDs at 1
- changed the deploy and test scripts accordingly

The test still fails with the same message, that the specified args were not emitted in any of 10 emitted NFTMinted events
=> that means the event fires properly each time the safeMint is called from bulkMint, problem is the arguments inside. But I still do not figure out if I'm writing the test wrongly or if the contract is the issue

The test is passing when only the uri is passed in, the tokenID is what seems to be posing a problem

- successfully tested that the `_currentTokenId` is 10, which means that all 10 NFTs have been correctly minted

- I keep looking for an understanding of why the tokenId is not being fired with the event.
