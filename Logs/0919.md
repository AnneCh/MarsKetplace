as I kept running tests and scanning the errors that I could, I realised that the problem does not come from the scripts that Moralis' server is gathering from, but from the fact taht I had deleted my original pinned images with metadata, and ONLY reuploaded the images, without the metadata... that's probably why the console.log() command does not retrieve the metadata object but only returns `undefined`.

Working now on reuploading through the pinata script, should be ready to re-test this afternoon

==== I reuploaded everything, the `TOKEN_URI` now finally display the metadata with link to image, but image does not load tho.

That being said, the console STILL RETURNS `undefined`

FOUND IT. there was a mistake on the script `update-front-end`, it was not the correct abi that was being rendered!

but the ipfs takes an eternity to load, and even does not load correctly....
