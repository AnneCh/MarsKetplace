as I kept running tests and scanning the errors that I could, I realised that the problem does not come from the scripts that Moralis' server is gathering from, but from the fact taht I had deleted my original pinned images with metadata, and ONLY reuploaded the images, without the metadata... that's probably why the console.log() command does not retrieve the metadata object but only returns `undefined`.

Working now on reuploading through the pinata script, should be ready to re-test this afternoon
