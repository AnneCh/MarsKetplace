today I'm stuck again with `yarn hardhat node` not producing the adequate result.

I've removed the `artifacts` and `cache` folders, even deleted `yarn.lock` and ran `yarn` again.
Same result, `yarn hardhat node` compiles and run the deploy script.

I've open a new project and copies pasted my code, ran `yarn hardhat node` and I sucessfully started the hardhat server... but as soon as I closed the server and tried to start a new one, `yarn hardhat node` ran the compile and deploy.
I've once again removed `artifacts` and `cache` folders but nothing changed.

And googling the question has not brought any similar situation yet
