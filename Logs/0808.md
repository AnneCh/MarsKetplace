today I'm stuck again with `yarn hardhat node` not producing the adequate result.

I've removed the `artifacts` and `cache` folders, even deleted `yarn.lock` and ran `yarn` again.
Same result, `yarn hardhat node` compiles and run the deploy script.

I've open a new project and copies pasted my code, ran `yarn hardhat node` and I sucessfully started the hardhat server... but as soon as I closed the server and tried to start a new one, `yarn hardhat node` ran the compile and deploy.
I've once again removed `artifacts` and `cache` folders but nothing changed. I've run `yarn hardhat clean`, still same thing happening.
Tried `npx hardhat node`, and the compiler and deploy script ran again...

And googling the question has not brought any similar situation yet.

It seems like it needs to deploy the contracts and then start the server.
I'm not sure I understand that fully, and I don't recall having that happening at the start of this project, or when reproducing tutorials

=> now working on writing tests and acquiring more knowledge and experience in writing tests
