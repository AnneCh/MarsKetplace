- added two more contracts to mint two more NFTs

- image NFT still not displaying on front end => need to explore NFTStorage, other people have complained about the number of requests exceeding the limits set by Pinata

!! Will need to think about updating contracts, minting, deploy and tests scripts if I move to NFTStorage, the URIs will be different

- I had an issue with starting the node, it returned the error : `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/anne/HAAAAAAAA/MarsKetplace/artifacts/build-info/83fe6550df34c65606ff72cf8f1ef087.json'`
  => I deleted the artifacts folder, ran `yarn hardhat deploy` followed by `yarn hardhat node` and then it worked.

=> have to work on the `mint-and-list` script I think, cause it's not suited to mint from different contracts yet
=> update-font-end will also need to be modified to accomodate for the two other tokens (DONE)

=> great, now for some reason when I run the mint and list script, the server is no longer registering those events, hence the front end is not being updated.
-> the sync is correctly workind and so is the `moralis:cloud` command
-> the transactions are recorded as per the tracking of my wallet's activity on the hardhat network, so it is correctly synced, but the events are not recorded
