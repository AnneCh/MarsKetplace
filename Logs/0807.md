Goal today is to rewrite the contract to include the loop and fix the tokenid issue

-   created mapping to link the tokenID to the array of strings of token URIs
-   implemented lines in the contract's code to get that token uri/pass it to the \_setTokenURI (`_setTokenURI(tokenId,_allTokenURIs[tokenId]);`)

The contract got deployed and verified on etherscan but trying to read the contract, it does not return the 0th URI string

=> let's see after writing the loop to mint all of them

=> writing unit tests after writing the loop and before testing on rinkeby

=> still having the problem of, when writing `yarn hardhat node`, instead of starting the server , it deploys the contracts.
