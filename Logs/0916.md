Dear Code! weeks fly by and days without significant progress seem to accumulate faster than I can count them.
I came accross a very useful package import error fixing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUonWJ-Tb0 and will implement it on my `addEvents.js` which would no work before.

I posted on Moralis' forum about the cancel cloud function not working, but have not had any significant improvment. I'll delete this server and create a new one, and try again.
=> nope, still not creating event listeners through the script....

=> the only way I could make it work was through deleting my server and starting a new one. Now both cloud functions are working.
Now, on to adding the buy function and test it out
