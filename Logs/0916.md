Dear Code! weeks fly by and days without significant progress seem to accumulate faster than I can count them.
I came accross a very useful package import error fixing, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFUonWJ-Tb0 and will implement it on my `addEvents.js` which would no work before.

I posted on Moralis' forum about the cancel cloud function not working, but have not had any significant improvment. I'll delete this server and create a new one, and try again.
=> nope, still not creating event listeners through the script....

=> the only way I could make it work was through deleting my server and starting a new one. Now both cloud functions are working.
Now, on to adding the buy function and test it out

Moved on to displaying the NFT on the front end, I modified the `update-frontend` file on the backend in order to accomodate for the abi to be updated as well, as the abi is required to get access to the tokenURI, needed to display the NFTs for sale

Somehow it's not grabbing the URI, as it's not being displayed in the console with `console.log(tokenURI)`
when running the tests, the token uri is differnet and not loading in the browser, but at least there is one.
In the console, trying to log `tokenURI` returns undefined.
so I don't know if there's a problem with the function grabbing the data (calling the `tokenURI` function of the contract), or the contract's code itself.
