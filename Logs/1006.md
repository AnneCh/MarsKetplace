and here we go again, once more my events are not syncing after I switched off my computer.
I've checked the MarsKetplace contract address, and it's still the same, so that error is off the table (even created a new event listener to check it, no events synced...)

I'ts becoming a bit too frustrating at that point, so I'll make a post on the moralis forum
