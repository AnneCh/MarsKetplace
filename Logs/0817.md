Yesterday I started writing the contract that will actually sell the NFTs

I'm still following Patrick's model of the NFT Marketplace, but because my architecture differs from his in the sense that I'm minting 10 NFTs in one contract, it looks like I only have one contract address as a data to pass into the listing function.

I wanted to start testing the first few lines of the contract before moving forward (contrary to what Patrick does in his tutorial) but I'm stuck on this part of passing one contract address for 10NFTs.

I can totally see that I'm missing something, but can't figure out what. I will keep watching his tutorial without populating my code too much, the answer may be at a later timestamp.

On the other hand, I had a lead on why my test is failing, and it seems to be because I call `bulkMint()` 10 times instead of once, to verify the event firing.
But in this case, why was the test passing when the event only had one argument?
I'll still explore this lead as it looks logical, and see if I can re-write the test in a better way
