I've decided to follow with implementing only one NFT for now, with the risk to have to refactor the entire code later on.

I'll move the `MintNFT.sol` contract to a different folder, along with its related test and deploy scripts.

Now, onto writting tests for MarsKetplace.

====> I've also been warned by a security bot on github (`dependabot`) that several of my dependencies have vulnerabilities that I need to address.

- `node-fetch`, ran the command `npm install node-fetch`
  => I reverted that action by overriding the current commit with its parent that had not had that node-fetch command : I was getting double the warnings from the `dependabot`

* Having a problem with the function `mintNft.owner()` which is supposed to assert that the owner of the NFT contract (and consequently of the NFT) is the `deployer` address.

The test gets back to me with:

```
1) Basic NFT minting tests
       Deployment
         should set the right owner:
     TypeError: mintNft.owner is not a function
```

I've tried turning the function into a `ownerOf` passing it the tokenId of 0, but it didn't work either

I'll keep working on that issue while writting tests for the rest of the `MarsKetplace` contract.
