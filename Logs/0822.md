I've decided to follow with implementing only one NFT for now, with the risk to have to refactor the entire code later on.

I'll move the `MintNFT.sol` contract to a different folder, along with its related test and deploy scripts.

Now, onto writting tests for MarsKetplace.

====> I've also been warned by a security bot on github (`dependabot`) that several of my dependencies have vulnerabilities that I need to address.

- `node-fetch`, ran the command `npm install node-fetch`
  => I reverted that action by overriding the current commit with its parent that had not had that node-fetch command : I was getting double the warnings from the `dependabot`
