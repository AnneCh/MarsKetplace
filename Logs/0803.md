This repository is based on a common project with Warren Dubery, to mint and sell NFTs representing plot of lands for sale on Mars

After several back and forthes, I've decided to try to create this project on my own to test some things out, especially in terms of framework used

Resources:
-Patrick Collins' tutorials on NFTs and NFT Marketplace using
    - hardhat
    - openzeppelin
    - pinata to pin on IPFS
    - Moralis as a server and front-end framework
