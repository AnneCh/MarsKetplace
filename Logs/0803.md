This repository is based on a common project with Warren Dubery initiated in July 2022, to mint and sell NFTs representing plot of lands for sale on Mars, as part of our portfolios.

After several back and forthes and Warren getting busy with other projects, I've decided to try to create this repo on my own to test some things out and see if I could make it work.

Resources:

-Patrick Collins' tutorials on NFTs and NFT Marketplace using - hardhat - openzeppelin - pinata to pin on IPFS - Moralis as a server and front-end framework
